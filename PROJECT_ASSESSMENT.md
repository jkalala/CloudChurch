# Project Assessment: Mobile Church Management System

## What Has Been Built

### Core Features
- **Member Management:** Add, edit, bulk update, and manage church members, including attendance and status.
- **Event Management:** Create and manage church events and activities.
- **Financial Management:** Track donations, tithes, and church finances.
- **Authentication:** User authentication, session management, and profile management (with Supabase).
- **Feature Management:** Toggle features on/off, with dependency management and categories.
- **AI-Powered Tools:**
  - **AI Email Generator:** Generate personalized emails for members (pastoral care, welcome, birthday, event invitation, follow-up, newsletter).
  - **AI Bible Tools:** Bible study, devotional, and search tools.
  - **AI Music Ministry:** Choir management, music planning, and practice tracks.
  - **AI Sermon Assistant:** Sermon writing and planning.
  - **AI Insights Dashboard:** Analytics and reporting.
- **Pastoral Care:** Manage care records, assign care team members, and track support.
- **Outreach CRM:** Community outreach and relationship management.
- **Live Streaming:** Stream services and manage online congregation.
- **Communication Tools:** SMS, email, and notification systems.
- **Gamification:** Engagement and rewards for members.
- **Offline Capabilities:** Some offline support for key features.
- **Biometric/Fingerprint Authentication:** (Partially implemented, with mock/fallbacks for build compatibility).

### UI/UX
- Modern, component-based UI (React + Next.js + Tailwind).
- Mobile-first design with mobile navigation, bottom nav, and responsive layouts.
- Dialogs, modals, and dashboards for various features.
- Language selector and i18n support.

## What Needs to Be Fixed or Fully Implemented

### API Routes
- **Not Implemented:** Several API endpoints (e.g., `app/api/auth/session/route.ts`, `app/api/profile/route.ts`) return "Method not implemented during build" (HTTP 501). These need real implementations for POST/PUT actions.
- **Fallbacks/Mocks:** Many services (e.g., fingerprint, elasticsearch, pastoral care, database actions) use mock implementations or return demo data for build compatibility. These need to be replaced with real database/service logic.

### Feature Gaps & Incomplete Areas
- **Biometric/Fingerprint Authentication:** Only mock/fallback logic is present. Needs real WebAuthn integration and secure credential storage.
- **Elasticsearch:** Search is a fallback and always returns empty results. Needs real search/indexing logic.
- **Pastoral Care:** CRUD operations use demo data, not a real database.
- **Financial Transactions:** TODOs for injecting real user IDs and proper transaction handling.
- **Bulk Actions:** Some bulk actions (export, delete) are mocked or only affect local state.
- **AI Tools:** While the UI is present, some AI features may not be fully wired to backend services or may use placeholder logic.
- **Testing:** There are some test files, but comprehensive test coverage is unclear.

### Technical Debt
- **Hardcoded Supabase Keys:** Fallback keys are present in the code, which is a security risk.
- **Error Handling:** Some error handling is basic or just logs to console.
- **Feature Management:** While robust, could benefit from server-side persistence (currently uses localStorage).
- **Accessibility:** No explicit mention of accessibility (a11y) best practices.

### 3. Security & Privacy
- Remove all hardcoded secrets from the codebase.
- Implement robust authentication (OAuth, SSO, MFA, biometric).
- Ensure GDPR and global privacy compliance.
- Add audit logs and permission management.

### 4. Advanced Features
- **Mobile App:** Build a companion mobile app (React Native/Flutter).
- **Push Notifications:** Real-time notifications for events, reminders, and messages.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Custom dashboards, trends, and predictive analytics.

- Improve accessibility (WCAG compliance).
- Add onboarding flows and in-app guidance.
- Provide extensive documentation and help resources.

### 6. Scalability & Reliability
- Move feature toggles and settings to a server-side store.
- Add caching, rate limiting, and monitoring.
- Use CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.

### 7. Marketing & Growth
- Add referral and invite systems.
- Support white-labeling for different churches/organizations.
